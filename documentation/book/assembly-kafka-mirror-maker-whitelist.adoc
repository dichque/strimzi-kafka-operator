= Whitelist

It is possible to specify what are the topics that the Kafka Mirror Maker has to mirror from the source to the target Kafka cluster.
The so called "whitelist" is defined in the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource.
It is a regular expression used for specifying from the simpler case with a single topic name to complex patterns.
For example, it is possible to mirror two topics named A and B using "A|B" or all topics using "*".
Multiple regular expressions separated by commas can be passed to Kafka Mirror Maker as well.
