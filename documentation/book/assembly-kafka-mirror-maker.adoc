= Kafka Mirror Maker

The Cluster Operator deploys one or more Kafka Mirror Maker replicas, which can be used to replicate data between Kafka clusters.
Such a process is named "mirroring" for avoiding confusion with the Kafka partitions replication concept.
The Mirror Maker consumes from a source cluster and produces to a target cluster.

Example `KafkaMirrorMaker` resources and the details about the `KafkaMirrorMaker` format for deploying Kafka Mirror Maker can be found in
xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-mirror-maker-str[Kafka Mirror Maker configuration].
