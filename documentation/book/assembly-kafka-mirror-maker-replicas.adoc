= Replicas

It is possible to run multiple Mirror Maker replicas.
The number of replicas is defined in the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource.
Running Kafka Mirror Maker with multiple replicas can provide better availability and scalability.
However, when running Kafka Mirror Maker on {ProductPlatformName} it is not absolutely necessary to run multiple replicas of Kafka Mirror Maker for high availability.
When the node where Kafka Mirror Maker is deployed to crashes, {ProductPlatformName} will automatically take care of rescheduling the Kafka Mirror Maker pod to a different node.
However, running Kafka Mirror Maker with multiple replicas can provide faster failover times, because the other nodes will be already up and running.
